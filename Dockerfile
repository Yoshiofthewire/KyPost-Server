# Every base image is pinned by DIGEST, not just by tag.
#
# The Ollama tarball below is pinned to a published SHA-256 with a paragraph
# explaining why unpinned build inputs are unacceptable. That argument does not
# stop at the one dependency it was written about: a tag is a mutable pointer,
# `debian:stable-slim` moves on every point release, and even `golang:1.26.6`
# is republished when its own base is rebuilt. Two builds of the same commit
# shipped different userlands, which is exactly the property the Ollama pin
# exists to prevent.
#
# Tag and digest are both written out. The tag is what a human reads; the digest
# is what Docker resolves. They must be bumped together — a digest that no longer
# matches its tag is a silent lie about what is being built, so re-resolve with:
#
#   docker buildx imagetools inspect golang:<tag> --format '{{.Manifest.Digest}}'

# buildx re-upload the whole 1.68 GB to the Actions cache on `cache-to`. That
# turned a 2-6 minute ci-docker into a 16 minute one on the first PR that

# Without this, "the container is running" was the only liveness signal — and it
# is a bad one. The endpoint is unauthenticated and returns 503 (not 200) when the
# health service reports unhealthy, so this tracks the application's own view of
# itself rather than just TCP liveness.
#
# This makes an unhealthy container visible (in `docker compose ps`, and to any
# orchestrator that polls it). It does not restart anything: Docker Engine's
# restart policies react to a container exiting, and health status only drives
# replacement under Swarm.
#
# Self-healing comes from supervisord plus Docker's restart policy, not from
# this probe: a supervised program that exhausts its (bounded) startretries goes
# FATAL, the crashexit event listener takes PID 1 down, the container exits, and
# `restart: unless-stopped` restarts it with backoff. See supervisord.conf.
#
# start-period is generous because first boot pulls the Ollama model.
#
# Tries http first, then https, because TLS_CERT_FILE/TLS_KEY_FILE can turn this
# listener into HTTPS (see backend/internal/api/tls.go) and a fixed scheme here
# would then fail every probe forever — marking a perfectly healthy container
# unhealthy, which is the exact false signal this check was added to remove. -k
# on the https attempt is correct and not a shortcut: the probe is a loopback
# call to the same process, and the certificate is issued for the public
# hostname, not for 127.0.0.1, so verification could never succeed.
