// TestAllSweepersExitOnSharedContextCancel proves that a single, real,

// three background sweepers (Task 20) instead of context.Background() —
// genuinely stops every one of them: StartPickupSweeper,
// StartSendAsCooldownSweeper, and StartOllamaVersionMonitor all return
// promptly once that one shared context is canceled.
//
// Before the fix, each sweeper ran on context.Background(), which never
// cancels — so this exact test (cancel the shared context, wait for all
// three goroutines to exit) would hang and time out, which is precisely the
// leaked-goroutine failure mode Task 20 closes.
